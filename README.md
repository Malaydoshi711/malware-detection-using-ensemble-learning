I implemented Ensemble Learning algorithms like XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Light GBM, GBM to develop a sophisticated malware detection system. The project involved utilizing Grid Search Cross-Validation (CV) to optimize the model's hyperparameters, significantly enhancing its accuracy and efficiency in identifying malware. Key findings demonstrated that LightGBM is the most effective model in finding malware with an accuracy of 96.71%.
